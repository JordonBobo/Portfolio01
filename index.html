    <div>Then Siduri said to him, ’If you are that Gilgamesh who seized and killed the Bull of Heaven, who killed the
      watchman of the cedar forest, who overthrew Humbaba that lived in the forest, and killed the lions in the passes of the
      mountain, why are your cheeks so starved and why is your face so drawn? Why is despair in your heart and your face like
      the face of one who has made a long journey? Yes, why is your face burned from heat and cold, and why do you come
      here wandering over the pastures in search of the wind?<br>Gilgamesh answered her, ‘And why should not my cheeks be starved and my face drawn? Despair is in my heart and
      my face is the face of one who has made a long journey, it was burned with heat and with cold. Why should I not wander
      over the pastures in search of the wind? My friend, my younger brother, he who hunted the wild ass of the wilderness and
      the panther of the plains, nay friend, my younger brother who seized and killed the Bull of Heaven and overthrew
      Humbaba in the cedar forest, my friend who was very dear to me and who endured dangers beside me, Enkidu my
      brother, whom I laved, the end of mortality has overtaken him. I wept far him seven days and nights till the worm fastened
      on him. Because of my brother I am afraid of death, because of my brother I stray through the wilderness and cannot rest.
      But now, young woman, maker of wine, since I have seen your face do not let me see the face of death which I dread so
      much.'
