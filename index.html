Hello and welcome to my portfolio. My name is LX Jordon Bobo, but prefer Jordon or Jordan. 
This page lets me show off my [soon to be] awesome potential and I encourage anyone reading 
this to feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or are interested in anything 
you see in my portfolio. This page is devoted to my transition to becoming a coder or web 
developer. <br> <br>

Although I have had a lifelong interest in computers and coding, and even built my first 
computer at age 10, my experiences in high school and college encouraged me to pursue my 
other passions such as history, agriculture, and linguistics. After getting my bachelors 
degree from Utah State University, I initially attempted to pursue a career in archiving 
and library science, and spent nearly 4 years working at the Murray Library. While I was 
there, I helped facilitate the procurement and deployment of a new Integrated Library System. 
That project rekindled my appreciation for software development and I decided to pursue 
coding and analytics which brought me to my current employer. <br> <br>

I work as a Systems Support Specialist for the Utah Higher Education Assistance Authority, 
which is part of the Utah System of Higher Education. Every day I get to work with some pretty 
great people to help make sure that education is available to anyone and everyone. I work 
mostly behind the scenes monitoring and troubleshooting software and computer scripts that 
were developed in-house, granting and revoking access to various databases, programs, and 
networks, as well as assisting employees and clients with our company’s software. <br> <br>

In order to improve my skills and continue to pivot my career toward software and coding, I 
am currently engaged in the University of Utah’s 
<a href="https://continue.utah.edu/proed/academy/certificate/web-coding-bootcamp" target="_blank">
Coding BootCamp </a> 
in order to advance my skills 
in full stack development. My original goal was to use the skills learned in the bootcamp to 
improve my position with my current employer, but opportunities to join the Application 
Development team are very limited. Rather than being content to wait a year or more before 
I can actually start working as a developer, I am actively seeking, with the knowledge and 
full support of my boss and co-workers, any opportunities to work in the field of software 
development.  <br> <br>
